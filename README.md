## Hi there 👋

🚀 Ali M. Sadeghi | Ph.D. Student @ Virginia Tech | Robotics & Autonomous Systems

Passionate about quadrupedal robotics, nonlinear control, and data-driven algorithms. Developed advanced MPC and learning-based controllers for agile locomotion and manipulation. My experience spans autonomous vehicles and vehicle dynamics at CNH Industrial. Skilled in C++, MATLAB, Python, ROS, and RaiSim.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on the locomotion of legged robots.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to play 🏓 because it helps my mind solve perception, control, and decision-making problems in the twinkling of an eye!
