## Hi there 👋

My name is Ali.
I'm a Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech, and I'm working on Robotics and Controls.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the locomotion of legged robots.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to play 🏓 because my mind keeps solving optimization, control, and decision-making problems in the twinkling of an eye!
