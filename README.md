## Hi there 👋

My name is Ali. Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech, specializing in Robotics, Autonomous & Dynamical Systems. I hold an M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering focusing on Vehicle Dynamics.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the locomotion of legged robots.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to play 🏓 because it helps my mind solve perception, control, and decision-making problems in the twinkling of an eye!
